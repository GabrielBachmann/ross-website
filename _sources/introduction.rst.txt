What you need to do to start using ross 
=======================================

.. _introduction:

Programming language: Python
----------------------------

Ross - rotordynamic open-source software is an Python application for rotordynamic
analysis. If you don't have Python installed in your machine, the first thing you should do is install it.

Since ross requires a number of packages to be installed besides
Python, such as numpy, we recommend installing Anaconda 
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ which is a distribution of Python for scientific computing
that aims to simplify package management and deployment. It contains Python and a large number
of packages that are commonly used.
Alternativaly, you may refer to the `Python website
<http://www.python.org/>`_.
Ross's code was tested in Python 3.6 and higher, so make sure you
get a similar version.
Although you don't need to know Python to run ross,
you need to be able to follow the instructions in :ref:`tutorial`, some coding included.
